Yes that's right, the famous computer game you've all played is now available
for your calculator.  For those don't know, the objective is to swap 2 adjacent
gems, so that at least one of them forms a group 3 or more adjacent gems that are the
same type and make them disappear, scoring points.

Controls:
Arrows: move cursor
On+Arrows: swap gem
Clear: exit
